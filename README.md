# WbsAlgorithms

This repository contains C# implementations of selected data structures and algorithms each with a set of unit tests. Majority of code
contains solutions to excercises from the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick (chapters 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3). There are also algorithms 
from other sources.

# References

Below, there is a list of sources used to create the C# code. The names in brackets indicate a comment in the code that references to
a particular source. For example, for excercises from the Robert Sedgewick's book "Algorithms" search for the comment ``[Sedgewick]``.
