# WbsAlgorithms

This repository contains C# implementations of selected algorithms, such as: 

* [Karatsuba Integer Multiplication](./WbsAlgorithms/Arithmetic/IntegerMultiplication.cs)
* [Strassen's Matrix Multiplication](./WbsAlgorithms/Arithmetic/MatrixMultiplication.cs)
* Sorting algoritms: [MergeSort](./WbsAlgorithms/Sorting/MergeSort.cs), [QuickSort](./WbsAlgorithms/Sorting/QuickSort.cs), [InsertionSort](./WbsAlgorithms/Sorting/InsertionSort.cs)
* [Finding the closest pair of points in O(n&#183;log(n))](./WbsAlgorithms/PairPointMinMax/ClosestPair2D.cs)
* [RSelect](./WbsAlgorithms/Searching/RSelect.cs) (Randomized Selection) and [DSelect](./WbsAlgorithms/Searching/DSelect.cs) (Deterministic Selection)
* [BFS](./WbsAlgorithms/Graphs/BreathFirstSearch.cs) (Breath First Search) and [DFS](./WbsAlgorithms/Graphs/DepthFirstSearch.cs) (Deph First Search)
* [MinCut](./WbsAlgorithms/Graphs/MinCut.cs) (Karger's Random Contraction)
* [Topological Sorting](./WbsAlgorithms/Graphs/TopologicalSorting.cs)
* [Strongly Connected Components](./WbsAlgorithms/Graphs/StronglyConnectedComponents.cs) (Kosaraju's Two-pass Algorithm) 

Each algorithm is accompanied by a set of tests.
