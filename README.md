# WbsAlgorithms

This repository contains C# implementations of selected algorithms and data structures each with a set of unit tests. Majority of code
contains solutions to exercises from the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick (chapters 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and partially 1.4) as well as
from the series "Algorithms Illuminated" by Tim Roughgarden. Below, there are a few examples of algorithms implemented in this
repository:

* [Karatsuba Integer Multiplication](./WbsAlgorithms/Arithmetics/IntegerMultiplication.cs)
* [Strassen's Matrix Multiplication](./WbsAlgorithms/Arithmetics/MatrixMultiplication.cs)
* Sorting algoritms: [MergeSort](./WbsAlgorithms/Sorting/MergeSort.cs), [QuickSort](./WbsAlgorithms/Sorting/QuickSort.cs)
* [Finding the closest pair of points in O(n&#183;log(n))](./WbsAlgorithms/PairMinMax/ClosestPair2D.cs)
* [RSelect](./WbsAlgorithms/Searching/RSelect.cs) (Randomized Selection) and [DSelect](./WbsAlgorithms/Searching/DSelect.cs) (Deterministic Selection)
