# WbsAlgorithms

This repository contains C# implementations of selected data structures and algorithms each with a set of unit tests. Majority of code
contains solutions to exercises from the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick (chapters 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and partially 1.4). There are also algorithms 
from other sources.

# References

Below, there is a list of sources used to create the C# code. The names in brackets indicate a comment in the code that references 
a particular source. For example, for exercises from the Robert Sedgewick's book "Algorithms" search for the comment ``[Sedgewick]``.
